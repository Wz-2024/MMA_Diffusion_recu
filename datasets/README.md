# <span style="color: #FFD700;">MMA-Diffusion Adversarial Images (Image modal attack)</span>

[![Page Views](https://badges.toozhao.com/badges/01HV61B5FJ60DS7KFK5XYWAJ47/green.svg)](.)

The MMA-Diffusion adversarial images benchmark comprises <span style="color: #800000;">61 adversarial images</span> generated by the adversarial attack methodology presented in the paper 
from **CVPR 2024** titled [**<span style="color: #800000;">MMA-Diffusion: MultiModal Attack on Diffusion Models.</span>**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17516) This resource is intended to assist in developing and 
evaluating defense mechanisms against such attacks. The adversarial images are designed to bypass the image safety checker in **SDv1.5**.

For each adversarial image, we also include the corresponding original image, mask, adversarial prompt, and four generated images sourced from SDv1.5's inpainting pipeline, offering deeper insight into the nature of the attack.


## <span style="color: #FFD700;">Dataset Format</span>

The benchmark is organized with the following fields:
| Tag | Explantion|
| ---------- | ---------- |
| file_name | The original input image. |
| mask | Image mask for the input image, generated by SAM. | 
| adv_image | Adversarial images crafted by MMA-Diffusion, designed to circumvent the safety checker of SDv1.5. |
| adv_gen_4 | Visualizations of the final synthesis.|
| adv_prompt | Paired adversarial prompts used to prompt SDv1.5's inpainting pipeline. |

For the fields adv_image, mask, and adv_gen_4, we additionally provide a `PyTorch tensor` representation same file name ending with `.pt` within the accompanying `mma_diffusion_images.zip` file.
